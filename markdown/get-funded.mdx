## Livepeer Grants Program

Livepeer Grants provide funding to projects that benefit the Livepeer ecosystem.
Grants are paid in Livepeer token (LPT), providing contributors with an
opportunity to both fund their projects AND build a position in the Livepeerâ€™s
Proof of Stake network. To receive a grant you will need a wallet that can
receive funds on Arbitrum.
